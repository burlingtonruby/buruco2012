    Beginning to work in more depth on the Speakers section;
    when the user clicks on the speaker, it will display their
    full bio.
    Added the 'Back To Speakers' arrow png to btv-assets folder.

    Built the layout/positioning of elements for the individual
    speaker bios. 
    Need to now make it so it appears when a speaker from the
    list of speakers is clicked.
    I was thinking the best way to do it was to grab the innerHTML
    of a speaker based on who is clicked. For example I click on
    John Smith, so I store his specific info (i.e. $(this).html)
    and store it into a variable, then append some new elements.
    I also created a separate css file specifically for the individual
    speaker bios, I figured this was best, so we don't have just 1
    giant css file.

    I decidied to use a fadeToggle() in jQuery to transition between
    the list of speakers, and the individual speaker bios.
    I've made it so when you click on a speaker's name, it stores
    their information. Also the Speaker Section Image and Title
    fade out, and are replaced by the new image and title for going
    back to the speakers list. I also created a separate js file 
    specifically for doing this, just to make it easier to read; as
    opposed to putting all the js in one file.
