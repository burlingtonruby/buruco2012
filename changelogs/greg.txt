		Worked on the Schedule section, having issues with the dotted line seperator,
		I am using bottom-border to created dotted line, but it's only working in FireFox,
		in chrome the dotted lines don't stretch all the way.
		Still need to add the styles for the schedule

	Changed the nav bar so it is fixed while the user is scrolling, clicking on the links
	now makes the page slide down to the section clicked on, only issue is that the nav
	bar offset needs to be fixed a bit

	I added some more styles to the schedule, I'm having some issues with the CSS3 multiple
	column layout and seperating each column with a dotted line.  In FirFox it works okay,
	but some of the columns aren't aligned the same; and in Chrome and Safari the columns
	are really funky looking

	Worked on styles for the Schedule section
	Scraped the CSS3 multiple columns; wasn't working, and used tables instead
	I made the fonts as close as I could to the comp, but they will probably have to
	be adjusted once it is on the site that allows me to use the fonts from TypeKit fonts

	I added the Sponsors section, and it is complete except for the fonts
	Tristan gave me the fonts that will be used, but I forget which fonts
	are applied to each section, so I'll have to check with him

	I added the Tickets section
	Also I noticed that, for example, if you click on the tickets link, the red
	triangle is over the Tickets link, but if you click the Top link to go to the
	top of the page, the red triangle remains over the Tickets link, which to me
	didn't make sense, so I made the red triangle hover over the buruco logo when
	the user clicks on any of the Top links

	I added the BTV section with all the styles
	
Feb-2-2012-13:11
	
	Removed a few extra break tags above the Speakers section.
	Changed the position styles of the additional-links div

	Worked on media queries
	Right now I am focusing on smaller laptop screen sizes / iPad
	Everything is adjuste between the following dimensions (width): 750 - 1300px
	The only thing that still needs to be adjusted up to this point it the red
	triangle, because I changed the position and font-size of the nav bar links,
	I think I might use javascript to detect the screen size, and based on that
	change the position of the red triangle (adding on to my switch statement).
	If anyone can think of a more efficient way of doing this, let me know :)

	Did some more work on the media queries
	Additional screen sizes between 725px and 625px (width) are now supported
	Some issues that are starting to come up since I am near the size of a mobile
	device, is the head nav bar, I can't keep lowering the font-size and moving
	the links to the left, because if they become too small it will become difficult
	for the user to click on them, I was thinking of moving them down below the buruco
	logo, but that would mean I would have to get rid of the sliding triangle, because 
	then it would look really weird.  Let me know what you guys think
