Feb-02-2012-14:06

	Building out html5/css3 from psd file
	Added the hrefs to the top of the nav bar
	Added CSS3 styles for links
	Added red triangle to be used for the selected link
	
Feb-02-2012-15:42

	The red triangle now hovers over the selected link in the top nav bar
	
Feb-02-2012-17:27

	Worked on the Speakers section
	Added the header of the section
	Worked on the 2 column list of speakers
	Worked on the line that divides each section
	
Feb-08-2012-9:36

		Working on getting the red triangle on the nav bar to slide when changing pages
		
Feb-08-2012-11:04

		Worked on the Schedule section, having issues with the dotted line seperator,
		I am using bottom-border to created dotted line, but it's only working in FireFox,
		in chrome the dotted lines don't stretch all the way.
		Still need to add the styles for the schedule
		
Feb-08-2012-12:27

	Changed the nav bar so it is fixed while the user is scrolling, clicking on the links
	now makes the page slide down to the section clicked on, only issue is that the nav
	bar offset needs to be fixed a bit
	
Feb-08-2012-13:30

	I added some more styles to the schedule, I'm having some issues with the CSS3 multiple
	column layout and seperating each column with a dotted line.  In FirFox it works okay,
	but some of the columns aren't aligned the same; and in Chrome and Safari the columns
	are really funky looking

Feb-10-2012-9:49

	Updated the folder 'btv assets' to btv-assets
	Deleted btv assets
	Updated id reference that was using javascript to jQuery
	
Feb-2-10-2012-11:16

	Worked on styles for the Schedule section
	Scraped the CSS3 multiple columns; wasn't working, and used tables instead
	I made the fonts as close as I could to the comp, but they will probably have to
	be adjusted once it is on the site that allows me to use the fonts from TypeKit fonts
	
Feb-2-2012-11:45

	I added the Sponsors section, and it is complete except for the fonts
	Tristan gave me the fonts that will be used, but I forget which fonts
	are applied to each section, so I'll have to check with him
	
Feb-2-2012-12:00

	I added the Tickets section
	Also I noticed that, for example, if you click on the tickets link, the red
	triangle is over the Tickets link, but if you click the Top link to go to the
	top of the page, the red triangle remains over the Tickets link, which to me
	didn't make sense, so I made the red triangle hover over the buruco logo when
	the user clicks on any of the Top links
	
Feb-2-2012-13:01

	I added the BTV section with all the styles
	
Feb-2-2012-13:11
	
	Removed a few extra break tags above the Speakers section.
	Changed the position styles of the additional-links div
	
Feb-13-2012-16:18

	Worked on media queries
	Right now I am focusing on smaller laptop screen sizes / iPad
	Everything is adjuste between the following dimensions (width): 750 - 1300px
	The only thing that still needs to be adjusted up to this point it the red
	triangle, because I changed the position and font-size of the nav bar links,
	I think I might use javascript to detect the screen size, and based on that
	change the position of the red triangle (adding on to my switch statement).
	If anyone can think of a more efficient way of doing this, let me know :)
	
Feb-13-2012-17:09

	Did some more work on the media queries
	Additional screen sizes between 725px and 625px (width) are now supported
	Some issues that are starting to come up since I am near the size of a mobile
	device, is the head nav bar, I can't keep lowering the font-size and moving
	the links to the left, because if they become too small it will become difficult
	for the user to click on them, I was thinking of moving them down below the buruco
	logo, but that would mean I would have to get rid of the sliding triangle, because 
	then it would look really weird.  Let me know what you guys think
	
Feb-15-2012-11:06

	Worked more on the media queries
	The supported screen size now goes down to 500px
	Some changes I made in order to support this small of a screen size include:
		- Removing the navigation links at the top
		- Removed the red sliding triangle
		- Removed the image at the top
		- Removed the images for the Speakers
		- At the bottom, in the BTV section, made links onto 2 lines instead of 1
		
Feb-15-2012-13:10

	Media queries now support down to a 450px screen 
	Updated the BTV section:
		- The links in this section are now off the screen (location, lodging, ect..)
		- Added a 'more' button
		- When the user clicks on the more button the links slide onto the left side of the screen
		
Feb-17-2012-10:26

	Updated styles for iPhone sized version of site
	Adjusted the logo
	Fixed the schedule table so it doesn't look so squished as before
	In the BTV section: made a simple More/Less button for the extra links (lodging ect..)
	
Feb-17-2012-12:15
	
	Began working on the media queries specifically for mobile devices
	It wasn't as easy as I expected, even though I altered the styles to 
	support the screen size of the iPhone for a computer browser, these
	styles looked completely different when on an actual mobile browser.
	I am almost done adjusting the styles for the iPhone
	
Feb-17-2012-12:35

	Finished up the media queries for the iPhone mobile browser.
	Let me know if anything needs to be changed
	
Feb-17-2012-13:43

	Began working on fixing the red sliding triangle for smaller screens.
	I think Sean's solution is best, I tried changing the position based on
	when the screen size is changed (also it checks the screen size when the page first loads),
	this method works, but I feel like Sean's method will reduce the amount of code that is needed.
	
Feb-20-2012-15:30
	
	Finished working on the sliding red triangle.
	It's position now is correctly adjusted based on
	the size of the browser window. Hooray!
	
Feb-22-2012-9:57

	There are a few issues with the position of the red sliding triange when the screen
	size was changed in Safari and Chrome, began fixing those issues.
    
Feb-22-2012-10:37

    Changed hard tabs to soft tabs.
    Deleted test.html
    
Feb-22-2012-11:07

    Beginning to work in more depth on the Speakers section;
    when the user clicks on the speaker, it will display their
    full bio.
    Added the 'Back To Speakers' arrow png to btv-assets folder.

Feb-22-2012-12:10

    Built the layout/positioning of elements for the individual
    speaker bios. 
    Need to now make it so it appears when a speaker from the
    list of speakers is clicked.
    I was thinking the best way to do it was to grab the innerHTML
    of a speaker based on who is clicked. For example I click on
    John Smith, so I store his specific info (i.e. $(this).html)
    and store it into a variable, then append some new elements.
    I also created a separate css file specifically for the individual
    speaker bios, I figured this was best, so we don't have just 1
    giant css file.

Feb-22-2012-13:00

    I decidied to use a fadeToggle() in jQuery to transition between
    the list of speakers, and the individual speaker bios.
    I've made it so when you click on a speaker's name, it stores
    their information. Also the Speaker Section Image and Title
    fade out, and are replaced by the new image and title for going
    back to the speakers list. I also created a separate js file 
    specifically for doing this, just to make it easier to read; as
    opposed to putting all the js in one file.

Feb-22-2012-13:34

    I got the fadeToggle() working, it now fades out the list and brings
    in the individual speaker's bio. Then when you click on the BACK
    TO SPEAKERS text or image, to does the reverse. Some of the styles
    get messed up, so I still need to fix those.

Feb-24-2012-10:14

    Finished on the getting the individual speaker's bio to appear when clicking
    on a specific speaker, and then back agaoin when clicking on the 'Back to Speakers'
    Image or Text.  Now I just need to add the media queries for this section.

Feb-24-2012-11:58

    Finished the media queries for the individual speaker bio section, with the
    exception of mobile devices

Feb-24-2012-13:33

    I realized that the additional-links div was starting to cause problems when
    switching between the list of speakers, and the individual speaker bio. It
    was because the position was absolute. Sean helped me fix it. There are only
    a few more media queries for the aditional-links div that I need to fix.

Feb-27-2012-14:20

    Switched the BTV and Sponsor sections and adjusted the sliding red triangle
    so that it is still aligned correctly.

Feb-27-2012-14:39

    Updated the addtional-links div in the BTV section.
    I removed the Packing and Family links. I also changed 'Dining' to
    'Restaurants'.  And adding Shopping, to keep the mobile version and
    web version parallel.
    
Feb-27-2012-17:36

    Began adding the sections that will contain the content for the BTV section:
    Directions, Restaurants, Attractions, Shopping, and Lodging. Added a new
    js file (btv_content_script.js), that controls the jQuery for that section.
    Added the scrolling affect; so if you click on Restaurants for example, the 
    screen will scroll down to the Restaurants section.
    
Feb-27-2012-19:41

    Started to work on the 'Directions' section. Created a button, that, when
    the user clicks it, gives directions based on current location. Has some
    bugs that I'm working out.
    
Feb-29-2012-9:55

    The Directions section now works, when you click the 'Get Directions' button,
    it gives you the directions from your current location to the address specified.
    
Feb-29-2012-10:31

    Started to work on the Restaurants section; just addded 1 restaurant (Sweetwaters).
    I added a new stylesheet (btv_content_style.css) to control the styles just for the
    additional content within the BTV section: Directions, Restaurants, Attractions,
    Shopping, and Lodging.  The font styles might have to be tweeked.
    
Feb-29-2012-11:14

    I added to more restaurants: Vermont Pub & Brewery and L'Amante.
    I also updated the 'Get Directions' button so that there are now 2 links:
    Website | Get Directions
    
Feb-29-2012-11:47

    I began working on adding and styling the Attractions section. So far I have
    only included 1: Echo.  I am also thinking of insteading of having long list
    of restaurants, attractions, etc.. have it so when you click on one of the 
    additional links, it fade toggles that section, similar to how the speakers
    section works.
    
Feb-29-2012-12:42

    I added the Burlington Bike Path, Downtown Burlington, and North Beach to
    the attractions section.
    
Feb-29-2012-12:59

    I am leaving the Shopping section blank for now, Adam had a really good idea; I'll
    go to a few shops around Burlington and see if they want to sponsor the event, if they
    do, there shop will be placed on the website and mobile applications. Until I talk to 
    the shops I skipped ahead to the lodging section. I added 1 hotel (Hilton) and applied
    styles to it.
    
Feb-29-2012-13:22

    Worked on the 'Get Directions' links, now when you click on them, it opens
    up a new tab to google maps; google maps asks if it can use your current location
    and then shows you directions to the place you clicked on, i.e. Hilton. Having some
    trouble though with the Church Street address, I just tried using Church Street as the
    address and it doesn't work too well.
    
Feb-29-2012-13:30

    I added Double Tree into the logding section.
    
Mar-2-2012-10:58

    Updated the directions section so it now gives directions to the correct address
    of the event. Removed the 'Shopping' section for now.  I also began working on
    the media queries for the BTV additional content section.
    
Mar-2-2012-11:29

    I finished up the media queries for the BTV section. I have to remember to add
    media queries for the speakers section. I also need to adjust the media queries
    for mobile devices.
    
Mar-2-2012-11:39

    I replaced Double Tree with the Marriot.
    
Mar-2-2012-12:02

    Switched the Lodging and Restaurants section.
    
Mar-2-2012-12:13

    Made a small change to the styles for the restaurant images.
    
Mar-2-2012-12:41

    Started new branch: speaker_bio where I will add the current speakers
    
Mar-2-2012-13:04

    I added the first speaker (Joshua Hull). He sent a link to a previous conference he
    spoke at; since he is giving a talk on the same topic, I just re-worded the summary
    that was given on the site (http://confoo.ca/en/2012/session/renee). He said to grab
    the image from this page as well.  We will probably need to use Adobe Bridge or
    Fireworks to resize his image.
    
Mar-2-2012-13:28

    I added the next 2 speakers. I resized the images (giving them generic class names!),
    however, this makes marc andre's image look very stretched out, dan croak's image very
    grainy, and only joshua hull's looks ok (except when it is full size). I don't have any
    image editing software (photoshop or fireworks would prob work) so I can't do this. I was
    thinking of having 2 images (one thumbnail and one full size) so the images don't have to be
    streteched out.  I still need to add more info for marc andre's bio.
    
Mar-13-2012-19:28

    Fixed some browser compatability issues in Safari. The position of the red bar that separates each
    section was getting messed up when clicking on a speaker. Just changed positioning from absolute to
    relative.
    
Mar-13-2012-20:03

    Fixed a few more minor browser issues with webkit. Also updated some of the media queries. I commented
    out the media queries for mobile devices until all the sections are complete.
    
Mar-13-2012-20:37

    Used the Image Preview tool in Fireworks to resize all current speaker images. It didn't really help with
    making them clearer when enlarged, but it allowed me to adjust the speaker_bio_script.js file so that when
    we do have the correct full size images, they will be correctly replace when a user clicks on a speaker's name,
    as opposed to just changing the height and width properties of the image. I also discovered that jpg image quality
    is reduced every time that it is saved, so I converted all speaker images to pngs.
    
Mar-14-2012-10:27

    Worked with Adam to fix image sizing for speakers. Added topic titles and where the speaker works.
    Also, I changed the dates for the conference to the 28 - 29.
    
Mar-14-2012-11:00

    Added 3 more speakers; corey haines, alex maccaw, and harold gimenez. I added in their photos, summaries, and
    where they work.
    
Mar-14-2012-11:08

    Updated the Schedule section. I added 3 days of events, and commented out the rest for now. For Friday the 27th, I left
    as is. For Saturday the 28th, I added 4 speakers, changed the time to TBA, and changed the location to Main Street Landing Performing Arts Center.
    I did the same for Sunday the 29th. I also commented out all the "Learn More" hrefs for now.
    
Mar-14-2012-11:24

    Removed the height and width properties from the images since we have now manually resized them with photoshop.
    
Mar-14-2012-11:31

    Updated application.js so that when you click on the Buruco logo, that also scrolls to the top of the web page and put the red
    triangle slider above the Buruco logo.
    
Mar-14-2012-11:48

    Made some changes to the padding-bottom styles of each section because there were really big gaps in between each section.
    
Mar-14-2012-12:04

    I was testing using geolocation for getting directions to the conference in FireFox, Chrome, and Safari. In FireFox and Safari
    it was working, but in Chrome it was not. I found out that if you are on a local webpage 'file:///', chrome will block it because
    of some security restrictions, so it should work fine once the site is live.

    - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5423938/html-5-geo-location-prompt-in-chrome
    
Mar-14-2012-12:17

    Changed location in Schedule section on Friday the 27th to TBA.
    
Mar-14-2012-12:20

    Added topic titles to alex maccaw, corey haines, and harold gimenez.
    
Mar-16-2012-16:15

    There were several issues that I hadn't noticed that I have now fixed. Some of the media queries were off
    for a few areas so I fixed those. I noticed that I wasn't removing the image at the top of the web page soon
    enough, so it was appearing really squished, fixed that. The bottom gray bar underneath the image was being pushed
    down, making an awkward gap, fixed that. Previously, in the BTV section, I had the links (Directions, Lodging, Restaurants,
    and Attractions) pushed off the screen and added a more button to bring them back once the screen was too small. Now that there
    are only 4 links, I changed this so it just remains as is with the horizontal bar and it doesn't get pushed off the screen, however,
    I left all the code that was there but just commented it out, in case we do add that Shopping section.  I told Adam the other day that
    I was testing the site on my small laptop screen and a larger monitor on campus, and that the speaker bio text would be cut off at some
    points (you would only see the top-half of the last line of words displayed for the bio), I fixed that issue for both monitor sizes.
    
Mar-16-2012-18:10

    I finished up the media queries for the iphone for the most part. It looks pretty solid right now, but there are still a few things that
    I need to figure out. I uploaded it to my website just for testing, since testing on a physical mobile device is always best, and I'll take
    it down when I'm done testing. I'll take some screen shots to send you guys. There are only 2 issues that I see right now. The button for 
    user's to click, which makes the google map image appear giving them directions to the conference is the new HTML5 button element, and
    it is very small, and you can't resize it. Also for the speakers, I need to add some sort of indicator so the users know that by clicking
    on a speaker's name, they will be able to view the full bio.
